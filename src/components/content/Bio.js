        Hi! My name is John. I am a dynamic and voracious learner who is always looking for a subject to learn or a project to build. Having a naturally logical, abstract and analytical way of reasoning is what drew me to software development. I hold the AWS developer associate certification, and I am currently studying for the certified Terraform associate exam.

        Since joining the industry as a professional software engineer in April 2022, I have had the pleasure of applying my expertise at both a startup and an established software company. During this time, I have gained a wealth of knowledge surrounding the software development lifecycle and process, most notably in cloud computing and Amazon Web Services. I am now actively seeking a role as an AWS cloud engineer.
