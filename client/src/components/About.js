            Hi! My name is John. I am a dynamic and voracious learner who is always looking for a subject to learn or a project to build. Having a naturally logical, abstract and analytical way of reasoning is what drew me to software engineering. During a full time software engineering course at General Assembly, I took to web development with brisk readiness. I&apos;m now actively looking for an opportunity to prove myself as a hardworking and enthusiastic member of a development team, who is eager to develop their skills at every chance. More specifically, I&apos;m looking for a role as a full stack, back end or front end engineer.  Some of my interests include mathematics, cryptography, Bitcoin and finance.
